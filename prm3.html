<h3><p>No sir, well I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore</p></h3> 
<h3><p>It's your turn to take a seat</p></h3> 
<h3><p>We're settling the final score</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>And why do we like to hurt so much?</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>I can't decide, you have made it harder just to go on</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And why, all the possibilities, well I was wrong</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa</p></h3> 
<h3><p>That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa</p></h3> 
<h3><p>I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>I wonder, how am I supposed to feel when you're not here?</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Cause I've burned every bridge I ever built, when you were here</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>I still try, holding on to silly things, I never learn</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Oh why, all the possibilities I'm sure you've heard</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa</p></h3> 
<h3><p>That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa</p></h3> 
<h3><p>I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating (Beating)</p></h3> 
<h3><p>that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>Pain make your way to me, to me</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And I'll always be just so inviting (So inviting)</p></h3> 
<h3><p>If I ever start to think straight</p></h3> 
<h3><p>This heart will start a riot in me, let's start, start, hey!</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>Why do we like to hurt so much?</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?</p></h3> 
<h3><p>That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa</p></h3> 
<h3><p>That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa</p></h3> 
<h3><p>That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Now I can't trust myself with anything but this</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa</p></h3>
