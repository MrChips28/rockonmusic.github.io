<h3><p>Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together</p></h3> 
<h3><p>I need the other one to hold you</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Make you feel, make you feel better</p></h3> 
<h3><p>It's not a walk in the park to love each other</p></h3> 
<h3><p>But when our fingers interlock, can't deny, can't deny, you're the worth it</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>Cause after all this time</p></h3> 
<h3><p>I'm still into you</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>I should be over all the butterflies but I'm into you, I'm into you</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And even baby our worst nights</p></h3> 
<h3><p>I'm into you, I'm into you</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Let 'em wonder how we got this far,</p></h3> 
<h3><p>'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Yeah, after all this time</p></h3> 
<h3><p>I'm still into you</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>Recount the night that I first met your mother</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And on the drive back to my house I told you that, I told you that I loved ya</p></h3> 
<h3><p>You felt the weight of the world fall off the shoulder</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And to your favorite song we sang along, to the start of forever</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>And after all this time</p></h3> 
<h3><p>I'm still into you</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>I should be over all the butterflies but I'm into you, I'm into you</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And even baby our worst nights</p></h3> 
<h3><p>I'm into you, I'm into you</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Let 'em wonder how we got this far,</p></h3> 
<h3><p>'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Yeah after all this time</p></h3> 
<h3><p>I'm still into you</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>Some things just, some things just make sense</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And one of those is you and I</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Some things just, some things just make sense</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And even after all this time</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>I'm into you</p></h3> 
<h3><p>Baby not a day goes by that I'm not into you</p></h3> 
<br>
<h3><p>I should be over all the butterflies but I'm into you, I'm into you</p></h3> 
<h3><p>And even baby our worst nights</p></h3> 
<h3><p>I'm into you, I'm into you</p></h3>
