							<h3><p>I wake up every evening With a big smile on my face</p></h3>
							<h3><p>And it never feels out of place And you're still probably working</p></h3>
							<h3><p>At a nine to five pace I wonder how bad that tastes</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>When you see my face Hope it gives you hell Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<h3><p>When you walk my way Hope it gives you hell Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>Now where's your picket fence love?
And where's that shiny car?</p></h3>
							<h3><p>And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense love</p></h3>
							<h3><p>I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying
</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<h3><p>If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well</p></h3>
							<h3><p>Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
                            <br>
							<h3><p>Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself</p></h3>
							<h3><p>Where'd it all go wrong?
But the list goes on and on
</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<h3><p>When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<h3><p>When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well</p></h3>
							<h3><p>Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>Now you'll never see
What you've done to me</p></h3>
							<h3><p>You can take back your memories
They're no good to me</p></h3>
							<h3><p>And here's all your lies
You can look me in the eyes</p></h3>
							<h3><p>With the sad, sad look
That you wear so well</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<h3><p>When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<h3><p>When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well</p></h3>
							<h3><p>Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<h3><p>When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell</p></h3>
							<h3><p>When you hear this song and you sing along but you'll never tell</p></h3>
							<h3><p>Then you're the fool, I'm just as well
Hope it gives you hell
</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>When you hear this song
I hope that it will give you hell</p></h3>
							<br>
							<h3><p>You can sing along
I hope that it put you through hell</p></h3>
